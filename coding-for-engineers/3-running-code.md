# Running code

The first computers were very bare bones, but they worked on the same principles as they do today. They run instructions (provided by the Central Processing Unit, CPU) on binary data, (loaded from Random Access Memory, RAM), and produce more data.

In the earliest days, you literally had to hand-code the instructions that the CPU supplied, which are extremely basic (but fast). Even today, some super-critical performance code, is written that way.

But fortunately, we are many decades from of the first programmers, and today we use high-level languages to interact with the computer. But in the end, what runs on your machine, are those low level commands that the processor understands.

To get from a high level language to machine-readable instructions, we use a compiler. It "compiles" your code into an application, which can then be executed.

There are also other mechanisms. Instead of compiling, you could "interpret" the code as you go, translating it into machine commands, as the code is executed. Interpreted languages, like Python, are quite popular, but they are orders of magnitude slower than compiled languages. It's pretty intuitive why. If you compile your code, the compiler can globally optimize your program, because it looks at the entirety of the code. It can also spend longer looking for the optimum translation, because it doesn't matter whether the compilation takes a bit of time. You do it once, and then your program runs at the native speed of the computer.

The disadvantage of compiling is, that now your code is specific to the processor and operating system you compiled it for. If you compiled for an Intel-based Windows system, the program doesn't run on a Mac, let alone an ARM-based Mac.

In order to get around the problem, people have introduced hybrid architectures. The Microsoft's C# compiler compiles your application into a simple code that looks like machine-language, but is actually cross platform. Because it is so similar to the instructions that actually run on your machine, and because it just-in-time-compiles it to your target machine, when you launch the app, the speed is quite close to native code.

Native code is still faster, and that's why the PicoGK Runtime, which is written in C++, is compiled for different archictures, and you need to run the right installer to get PicoGK working on your system.

The C# part of PicoGK is completely cross platform, and we try to implement as much as possible on the C# side, and only leave very performance-critical parts of the library to the C++ side.

## Installing the IDE

In order to compile your code, you first need to install a compiler on your system. Today, you usually use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which includes code editor, compiler, and debugger. The debugger allows you to inspect your code while it is running, step through it one instruction at a time, and see the contents of your variables.

We will be using Visual Studio Code, but everything explained here works similarly in other environments.

Follow these steps to install Visual Studio Code. This is probably the hardest part of what you will do today. I miss the days, when you switched on your computer, and you could just code. But once you have it up and running, we can start with the creative part.

## Compiling your code

From the previous chapter we know that, essentially, all code is encapsulated in functions. There is one special function that is called when your application is launched. This function *is* your application. When the function exits, your application terminates.

For the last couple of years, C# has simplified this a bit, so now the actual function is hidden.

When you create a new "Console Application" in C#, you will see a file called `Program.cs` â€” everything you put there is executed when the application launches, and once all the instructions are completed, your app terminates.

So, let's copy and paste the code we started with in the last chapter into `Program.cs`:

```c#
string str;
str = "Hello World";
WriteLine(str);
```

You will see that WriteLine is underlined with a wiggly red line, and when you try to compile, the application will not run.

Why is that?

WriteLine is not defined anywhere. So the compiler doesn't know how to use it. Remember that anything is a class in C#? So a function cannot exist without an associated class.

WriteLine is a function implemented in the system class Console. So, let's invoke it properly by adding the class name to it:

```c#
string str;
str = "Hello World";
Console.WriteLine(str);
```

If you compile the corrected code now, no errors will be thrown, and our application will run (very briefly, because it doesn't do much).

The debugger will show a lot of (really unnecessary) diagnostic messages in your output, but in there, you will see a `Hello World.`

Congratulations, you have run your first app.

## Summary

Let's quickly summarize what we just did.

We created a new Console App project. This project has a single main function, implemented in `Program.cs`. For simplicity, C# treats everything in `Program.cs` as a single function. When your App launches, the function is run, when your function completes, the App terminates.

We copied the code from our first examples. We compiled it successfully, and then where able to display some text. 

Now, this sounds all very simple, but this is the foundation of every App on every platform, whether on your computer or on your mobile phone. 

Even super complex applications like a web browser or image editor, rely on this simple structure. Their main function is just much more complex, and creates windows for graphics and many other things. To keep the program running for an extended period of time, the main function then stays in a long loop, processing user input, until the user asks to terminate the application. When this happens, the App exits the loop, then the main function, and the program terminates.

So now we have this out of our way, we can move on to the fun part.
